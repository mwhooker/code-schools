# code-schools

## purpose
Code schools are sprouting up everywhere, and it's no wonder.
Coding is a skill in high demand, and over half the population
is underrepresented in the industry.

My impression is that code schools can be divided into two categories:
Those fighting to fix the imbalance by teaching minorities in the industry,
and those wishing to profit from the high demand for engineers.

I think both models have their own roles. For profit schools are the free market at its best.
However, I also think that the inherent ethos of freedom and community that nurtured me and so many others
is incompatible with the idea.

The primary goal in this doc is to enumerate the different schools, sort them,
and perhaps eventually display metriculation/placement statistics as well as cost.

The secondary goal is to facilitate connections between the not for profit programs. I'm not aware of any
non-local organization between them (but I only googled a handful of terms), so I think finding out who they are
is important.

A neat thing to do would be to help lower the barrier to creating your own school. I would love to see an organization
of infrastructure to support a self replicating code school.
